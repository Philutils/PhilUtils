Who software developers have taken code here and there for their creation know we can win a lot of time by sharing. Sometimes also we lose time by copying half made stuff with no correct Error handling, there we lose time.

So here, I am specialized in Windows 32 bit - 64 sometimes Apps and libraries. Specifically Vb 6, VBA, VB.NET
Here I go with VB and VBA. Why? Next chapter tomorrow.
I want to share old code I've done, is tested and working good. I want to share for to reward the developer's community who all these years did allow me to find out ways in my programmation. I think of VbFrance, codeguru, stackowerflow and some others.

So, I have a lot of code and still a lot of "todo" in my code and I wanna publish clean code. As well, it will be first time that I publish this big work and now I begin small.

One functionality that is discussed in Software has to do with KnownFolders. See URL: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/knownfolderid

It looks good and Microsoft did big progress since I know them BUT: I want my code to work on new AND old systems. Goal: From 97 to 2011 :) ... so if you look again at the Url above about KnownFolders, and you look on old systems, ... se also had a way to read registry and find the "Special" folders like Desktop MyDocuments. Now with Knownfolders as discribed in Ms documentation, we have access to more than 100 constants and GUID's that will referr to known folders.

With my way of programming I want my soft to continue working on old systems, so I integrate new with old and I get this Class KnownFolders with access on them on each system from Win97 to Win 11

Please enjoy the reading.
