Who software developers have taken code here and there for their creation know we can win a lot of time by sharing. Sometimes also we lose time by copying half made stuff with no correct Error handling, there we lose time.

So here, Made with attention and Tested on Win97 Win XP Win 10 Word 13. Still todo is adapt API call #IF VBA for modern VBA.

Please I need Help. In my Soft I need at some point to know if dynamically if the current process (running my code) is X64 or X32 Process. Typically in VBA Word for to know if running new Word VBA7 or old Word 97 till 2015...

This X64X32.bas implements this But: I do not have a System VBA7 for to test

Would someone be so kind and test in dubug mode this moduse, with special attention at the places where written todo?

Thanks for kind help, Please do test X64X32.bas
